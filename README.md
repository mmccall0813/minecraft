A source code copy of classic.minecraft.net<br>
this isnt my code, and it doesnt work

if you want this to work, you will need to reverse engineer the client code to make a server, which wouldn't be easy. If you're up for a challenge and want to try to make a server, head to the client javascript and good luck!

This is also missing assets like textures, because at the time I made this I didnt know how to pull the assets out of it, and even now at the time of making the readme, I'm still not sure how to go about it. If you want a version with textures, go check out [RealSunCat's Reversed Minecraft Classic](https://github.com/RealTheSunCat/Minecraft-Classic-Reversed)
